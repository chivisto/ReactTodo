# ReactTodo
Isaac C

Well, i really struggled with this assignement, I can't find a way to get my components to seperate without breaking the whole app. I waited to finish this assignement because of being busy with other school assignments as well as work and personal commitments. With that said I was able to do the part that seemed most important to me which is keeping the todos on the page even after a reload. This is found in the LocalStg file in my components. I have about 2 empty components because I ran out of time to move them from the main file as i stated. but the app should work other than that, but it isn't pretty either just functional.
